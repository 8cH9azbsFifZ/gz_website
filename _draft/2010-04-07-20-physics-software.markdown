As this is scientific research software it is under heavy development and probably unuseable for others. Drop me a mail if you are interested in this code.



	
  * **Contributions to LAMMPS - Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator** The [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) is a massively parallel molecular dynamic simulation tool.


	
      * **Damped long-ranged coulombic potentials**

	
      * **HDF file format extensions**



If you like to use my _really_ experimental stuff, drop me a mail.

	
  * **Angular Distribution based local structure analysis**. Included in the main branch.

	
  * **lammps-vim // Vim syntax highlighting for LAMMPS scripts** Included in the main branch.
_git://repo.or.cz/lammps-vim.git_

	
  * **Local temperature/pressure detector** On demand. Drop me a mail.

	
  * **Strain rate detector** On demand. Drop me a mail.

	
  * **ClusterDetector // Cluster Detector**Detection of particle clusters. Written in C and including a Python interface.
_git://repo.or.cz/ClusterDetector.git_

	
  * **lm-algorithm // Levenberg-Marquardt-Algorithm**PY/HNC & OZ Equation Solver in Two Dimensions. The algorithm is described in this [report](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6kO4SX1CnShUGFObU8wUDl5Q3M).
[@Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lm-algorithm/)or _git://repo.or.cz/lm.git_
