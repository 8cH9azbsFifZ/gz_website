In the following post I show some visual results of my Voacap simulations. The visualization has been done using some python and shell scripting.


## Simulation Parameters








	
  * Antenna: isotrope

	
  * Mode: cw (required SNR for circuit reliability calculation: 24 dB)

	
  * Power: 50W

	
  * Transmitter location: JO40DA

	
  * Month: July

	
  * SSN:72.8

	
  * Time (UTC): 12h (=day) and 23h (=night)
