	the stopping of energetic clusters upon impact in matter. We investigate
	self-bombardment of both a metallic (Cu) and a van-der-Waals bonded
	(frozen Ar) target. Clusters with sizes up to N = 104 atoms and with
	energies per atom of E/N = 0.1–1600 eV atom−1 were studied. We
	find that the stopping force exerted on a cluster follows an N2/3-dependence
	with cluster size N; thus large clusters experience less stopping
	than equi-velocity atoms. In the course of being stopped, the cluster
	is strongly deformed and attains a roughly pancake shape. Due to
	the cluster inertia, maximum deformation occurs later than the maximum
	stopping force. The time scale of projectile stopping is set by t0,
	the time the cluster needs to cover its own diameter before impacting
	the target; it thus depends on both cluster size and velocity. The
	time when the cluster experiences its maximum stopping force is around
	(0.7–0.8)t0. We find that the cluster is deformed with huge strain
	rates of around 1/2t0; this amounts to 1011–1013 s-1 for the cases

  abstract  = {In the present work nanoindentation of the FCC-metals aluminium and
	copper has been investigated using atomistic simulations. The following
	topics have been covered: The effect of crystalline anisotropy on
	the Hertzian approximation, the influence of the interatomic potential
	on plastic deformation, structured surfaces, and the phenomenon of
	reversible plasticity. The simulations have been carried out on cubic
	substrates with a side length of about 25 nm using a rigid, spherical
	indenter with a radius of about 8 nm and an indentation velocity
	of about 10 m/s.
	
	The influence of the crystalline anisotropy of the (100), (110) and
	(111) surfaces has been investigated for copper and aluminium. The
	Hertzian solution is valid on the atomistic scale in the linear elastic
	regime with an orientation dependent reduced elastic modulus, which
	can be derived from the elastic constants of the potential. In the
	plastic regime, the influence of the orientation drops with increasing
	indentation depth and the hardness becomes independent on the orientation.
	This investigation validates the application of the Hertzian theory
	to nanocrystalline materials.
	
	It has been shown that despite deviations in the stable stacking fault
	energy simple pair potentials are capable of qualitatively modelling
	the elastic deformation, the critical indentation depth including
	the appropriate critical stress, the level of hardness, and actually
	the primary plasticity for ideal free surfaces. In the deep plastic
	regime, however, the simple pair potentials lead to an overestimation
	of the stacking fault size, which causes work-hardening. This indicates
	that pair potentials may be used under specific circumstances for
	meaningful parametric studies.
	
	The influence of the elastic stiffness on hardness has been investigated
	in a parametric study using a Morse potential. It has been shown
	that the crystalline hardness and the load-drop scale with the elastic
	stiffness, whereas the critical indentation depth is independent
	on the elastic stiffness. The proportionality of hardness to the
	theoretical strength could be confirmed.
	
	For a surface with an island of adatoms, the influence of the surface
	structure has been investigated. Below a specific size the island
	is pushed into the substrate and transported away from the indenter
	in form of prismatic loops; the results are independent on the primary
	structure on the surface.
	
	The phenomenon of reversible plasticity has been found for ideal (111)
	surfaces. The responsible mechanism has been identified as the cross-slip.
	After the onset of material transport the plastic deformation becomes
	irreversible and corresponds to the definition of the continuum theory.
	This finding is important, as it shows that the force-depth curve
	does not provide information on the plastic deformation. A criterion
	for the onset of irreversible plasticity based on the total strain
	is given.},

	We find that qualitatively many aspects of nanoindentation are fairly
	well reproduced by the simple pair potentials: elastic regime, critical
	stress and indentation depth for yielding, dependence on the crystal
	orientation, and even the level of the hardness. The quantitative
	deficits of the pair potential predictions can be traced back (i)
	to the fact that the pair potentials are unable in principle to model
	the elastic anisotropy of cubic crystals; (ii) as the major drawback
	of pair potentials we identify the gross underestimation of the stable

	Focussing on fcc materials, we investigate different pair and many-body
