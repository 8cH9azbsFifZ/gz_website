As described inÂ [http://www.ngunn.net/cyberworld/hamradio/t1/](http://www.ngunn.net/cyberworld/hamradio/t1/) I have successfully integrated a T1 tuner into my FT 817. My tuner was sensitive to noise on the 9V rail - using the 12V rail from the data port and some blocking capacitors I finally got the tuner working.![evernote-camera-roll-20150207-145037](evernote-camera-roll-20150207-145037.jpg)
