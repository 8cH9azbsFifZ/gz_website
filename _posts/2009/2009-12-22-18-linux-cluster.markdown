### Workshop


During my PhD thesis I have built a high-performance cluster at the Technical University
Kaiserslautern. Below you can find snipplets of the my software tools. Due to this work I was invited as a speaker to the Workshop on High Performance Computing: from design to application.




### Corvix


A linux distribution for scientific environments ([Corvix](http://merapi.physik.uni-kl.de/~wiki/doku.php?id=corvix)). The status of the distribution is currently out of order.
