Hiking is fun and QRP is fun. Both can be combined using homebrew equipment :)

This is my current light-weight QRP equipment for hiking:

	
  * ATS-4 ([KD1JV](http://kd1jv.qrpradio.com/))
  * T1 ATU ([Elecraft](http://www.elecraft.com/))
  * Antenna ([Buddipole](http://www.buddipole.com/))
    * VersaTee
    * Shock-cord Whip 7 elements
    * 2x Antenna Arm 22"
    * Ground wire (~10m)
    * Coax Cable (RG174)
  * PPK Straight Key ([Palm Radio](http://www.palm-radio.de/))
  * 10 AA Cells ([Eneloop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eneloop)) with [PowerPoles](http://www.andersonpower.com/)
  * Sennheiser Earphones
  * Everything tied together using hook-and-loop-tape
