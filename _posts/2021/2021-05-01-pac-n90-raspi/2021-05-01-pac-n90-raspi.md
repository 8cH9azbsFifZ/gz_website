Do you want to connect your air conditioning system (DeLonghi) into your
smart home system? With a little effort it is possible to reverse engineer
the IR remote control protocol and implement a software adapter.

Recently I implemented a small IR remote control for DeLonghi PAC AirConditioners on Raspi 
with MQTT support for integration in homeautomation systems (i.e. OpenHAB).
