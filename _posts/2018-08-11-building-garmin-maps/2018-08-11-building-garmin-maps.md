Recently I have created Garmin maps containing cave locations based on OpenTopoMaps. These maps contain height lines and custom POIs of caves. They can be used both on Garmin devices and Oruxmaps (on Android). A Makefile for Garmin maps is provided in [this Repo](https://github.com/8cH9azbsFifZ/garmin-opentopo).
